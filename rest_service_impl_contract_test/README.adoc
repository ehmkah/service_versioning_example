= Example for consumer driven contract Test with pact

* shows an example how to implement consumer driven contract test with pact

== Run Consumer Tests

. run `ConsumerTest` it will produce a file called `Service_Consumer-aProvider.json`
** this file contains everything we test, we are interested

. run `ServiceTest`- this is the producer part
** test load pact file from resources/pact, starts spring boot application and validates output
** attention it does not use generated file from `ConsumerTest`because normally you get the pacts from your consumers
** make some changes to Implementation and see how the report becomes red
